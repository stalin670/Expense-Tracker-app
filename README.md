## 🔐 Authentication Workflow

- **Signup/Login**: Users can create an account and securely log in.

- **Export Data**: Add functionality to export expenses as CSV or PDF files.
- **Group Expenses**: Support for group expense sharing and tracking.
- **Notifications**: Send reminders for upcoming payments or budget limits.
